This is Adam Liu!

I believe in couple of things:

**LOVE, CREATE, EXPERIENCE.**

I create software & videos, and I try my best to deliver this message through everything I create.

Right now it's 1st Sep. 2020, COVID-19 is still keeping most parts of the world closed, the world hasn't been this divided since I've been old enough to remember things, and societies are changing rapidly, good or bad.

No matter what, **LOVE** is the most powerful drive to lift us up, **CREATE** is the only way to build a better future, and only when you've **EXPERIENCE**d enough, you'd be able to appreciate how beautiful the world is, and understand why we should do our best to protect the good, and fight the evil.

And I'm only doing my part.
